Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::ChainMgr.

0.9 Sat Feb 11 23:11:45 2008
    - Added Net::IPv4Addr prerequisite to Makefile.PL (patch submitted by
      Dominik Gehl).
    - Updated perldoc documentation to properly discuss the delete_chain()
      API.  The material about the $jump_from_chain was missing (Darien
      Kindlund reported this issue).
    - Applied patch from Darien Kindlund to add the ability to specify the
      source MAC address via the --mac-source <addr> command line argument to
      iptables.

0.8 Fri Oct 17 11:35:15 2008
    - Added the ability to control the iptables execution model.  The default
      is to use waitpid(), but other options are to use system() or popen().
    - Added the ability to introduce a configurable time delay between each
      iptables command.
    - Added the ability to use a function reference for the SIGCHLD signal
      handler.
    - Added the ability to configure the number of seconds used as the alarm
      timeout for iptables command execution in the waitpid() execution model.
    - Passed IPTables::ChainMgr options for execution model, configurable alarm
      timeouts, the SIGCHLD signal handler reference, and the configurable
      number of seconds for additional sleeps between iptables commands to the
      IPTables::Parse module.
    - Bugfix for SIGALRM handling to be more consistent with an example from
      the perlipc man page.
    - Added append_ip_rule() so that new iptables rules can be appended to the
      end of a chain instead of just inserted at a particular rule number.

0.7 Sat May 17 10:49:15 2008
    - Added perldoc documentation for 0.7 release.
